# Statistics-Applied-in-Football


This repository contains a project that I developed to see how some probability and statistics concepts that I learned in the course of my degree could be applied in real life. For that, I chose to analyze the performance of Manchester City in the 2022–2023 Premier League season.


## Table of Contents


The project is divided into two parts: the first part represents a basic approach, analyzing the data of the 2022–2023 Premier League season, and the second part represents a more advanced approach, applying more advanced concepts to the data from the first part. I started with very simple things, like obtaining and cleaning the data, then counting the number of goals scored and conceded by Manchester City in the season, and so on. Then, in the second part, I moved on to more advanced concepts, like seeing if the Poisson distribution can be used to model this type of data. Finally, I used a statistical test to measure the level of significance of the results obtained.


## Technologies


The project was developed using the following technologies:


- Python 3.8.5
- Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4
- Pandas 1.1.3
- Numpy 1.19.2
- Matplotlib 3.3.2
- SciPy 1.5.2


## Conclusion


This project is a walk-through of some fundamental concepts of probability and statistics. For me, it represented a very interesting challenge to see how the concepts learned in the classroom can be applied in real life.
